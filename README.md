## Test Application for Iron Software

Basic implementation from [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/rnqGoCJqAd7lPrPgYwkEmT/Test-Design?type=design&node-id=1-2690&t=cccI3k0U59u4wnX7-0) provided on the email. I just used the latest CSS, Bootstrap and Codeigniter as a requirement.

### Tech Stack Used

- Codeigniter 4 (latest) running on PHP 7.4 installed via Composer
- Bootstrap v.5.0 ( Embeded libraries with embeded jQuery Libraries )
- Gotham Font ( Embeded )
- Simple JSON Structure for Data Manipulation

### Installation

- `composer install` to install the prerequisite of codeigniter
- `php spark serve` as a development server of the application
